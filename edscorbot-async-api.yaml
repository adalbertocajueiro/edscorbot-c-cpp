    #### Some useful links

    * [Ed Scorbot Python](https://github.com/RTC-research-group/Py-EDScorbotTool) - the main Github project with details about the entire project and the low level code to control the robotic arm

    * [Ed Scorbot Documentation](https://py-edscorbottool.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - documentation about the entire project

 
    #### Symbology

    * **CONTROLLER** - Arm's high level controller. The microservice service responsible for receiving messages from clients, handling the physical arm and notifying clients. It guarantees the arm works according with its requirements.

    * **CLIENT** = Any application that wants to interact with the arm. In our case, this application is an Angular front-end to provide a friendly user experience to the final user (human).

    * **CONTROLLER** and **CLIENT** can be publishers and subscribers at the same time. For each arm there is only one **CONTROLLER** and possibly many **CLIENTS**. The **CONTROLLER** is responsible for guaranteeing the correct funcioning of the arm in a scenario where many **CLIENTS** want to use the robotic arm. The arm accepts only one **CLIENT** at a time (which becomes the arm's owner). Other clients can use the arm only when the arm is free (there is no current owner).

    #### Communication Design

    The implemented controller follows a design containing three topics: 
      
    *  **metainfo** - to allow information exchange about specificities of each robotic arm (many arms can be available in a same broker). When a **CONTROLLER** connects to the broker, it automatically sends its meta information. **CLIENTS** also subscribe on this topic at startup to receive such meta information. 
    
    * **ROBOT_NAME/commands** - to allow **CLIENTS** to send commands to control the arm and **CONTROLLERS** to send notifications to **CLIENTS**. The **ROBOT_NAME** is a prefix of this topic to distinguish between different robots that can be available in a same broker. 


    #### Meta Info Object

    The information about each robotic arm (robot name, joints, range of values for each joint, etc) are encapsulated in an object called `MetaInfoObject`. Its internal structure is detailed as follows:
      * `signal` (required) - meaning if the meta information has been requested (**ARM_GET_METAINFO = 1**) by **CLIENTS** or if its is an answer from **CONTROLLER** to **CLIENTS** (**ARM_METAINFO = 2**) 
      * `name` - the robot name
      * `joints` - a list of amr's joints where each joint is a pair with its `minimum` and `maximum` values in angles)

      #### Commands Object 

      The functions and the answers exchanged between clients and the controller are encapsulated in an object called **CommandsObject**. Its internal structure is detailed as follows:
      * `signal` (required) - representing a `function` to be executed by the **CONTROLLER** or an `answer` sent by the **CONTROLLER**. The possible values are:
        * `ARM_CHECK_STATUS = 3` - a code for metainfo request from a **CLIENT**
        * `ARM_STATUS = 4` - a code for the metainfo response sent by the **CONTROLLER**
        * `ARM_CONNECT = 5` - a code for a connect request from a **CLIENT** that wants to become the arm's owner. If the arm is available, its **CONTROLLER** accepts the connection request, notifies all clients about it, move the arm to home position and notifies the owner that home position has been reached. When connecting to the arm, the owner waits untill the arm moves to home position before sending movements to it.
        * `ARM_CONNECTED = 6` - a code for the notification sent by the **CONTROLLER** about its current owner.
        * `ARM_MOVE_TO_POINT = 7` - a code for a request from a **CLIENT** to move the arm to a specific point. The user interface guarantees that only the arm's owner is able to move the arm, and the **CONTROLLER** accepts only movement commands from arm's owner.
        * `ARM_APPLY_TRAJECTORY = 8` - a code for a request from arm's owner to move the arm accoding to the points of a trajectory (a sequence of points). Each point represents a single movement to be executed by the robot.
        * `ARM_CANCEL_TRAJECTORY = 9` - a code for a request from arm's owner to cancel the current execution of a trajectory. The arm stops the execution and communicates the last point to which the arm was moved to.
        * `ARM_CANCELED_TRAJECTORY = 10` - a code for the answer sent by the **CONTROLLER** about the trajectory execution has been cancelled.
        * `ARM_DISCONNECT = 11` - a code for a disconnect request from arm's owner. 
        * `ARM_DISCONNECTED = 12` - a code for the **CONTROLLER** communicate its owner nas disconnected and the arm is available again. 
        * `ARM_HOME_SEARCHED = 13` - a code for the **CONTROLLER** communicate that the home position has been reached. While the arm is searching its home position, no other operation is allowed.

  'metainfo':
    description: Channel/topic provided to allow communication of metainfos. This channel plays the role of a "meta" channel where multiple **CONTROLLERS** can publish information about themselves and **CLIENTS** can obtain information about all registered arms, so they can choose which arm to connect.
